                        <li><h4>I believe that this project was a success. I base this opinion of that the outcome graph that is spit out by the plotting class is accurate. This model that I have made has behaved exactly how I wanted as it produces a graph that looks accurate to other sources and other models made online. Like the one I have taken inspiration from. This model solves and very complex problem for cities and governments every time there is an outbreak of a pandemic. This model simplifies the complex calculations of pandemic growth and simplifies it to a simple matter or inputting cities population and initial parameters of a virus/ bacteria. This model has a few limitations that I tried to address but I have run out of time to do them. They were like adding masks or adding vaccination which I tried to do but found it way to complex to do. The absence of these still left me with an accurate model that I am confident that the government could use. If was to do this project again there would be a few things I would do differently. One of them would be not to procrastinate with Report and the website making. I left the report to the last minute, and I caused it to be rushed and inaccurate. I have also ran out of time to do the video properly. For the next project I will try to improve on this. Another thing I could differently do would be manage my time better as I have done the research in the first week, but I have procrastinated with the code writing and report/website for a week which caused me to lose a a few ideas I had initially planned for the model to do. Over I think I have learned lots from this project by learing the basics of calculus, developing my knowledge of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), by using a variety of different classes and functions that did different things. This allowed the code to be modular, easly understood and easly added onto in the future if this model needed more advanced things like adding vaccination or adding a visual pandemic spread on a map.</h4></li>
