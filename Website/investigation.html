          <h4>I have set out to model the Pandemic Growth over a period in days. I want to model this growth as itâ€™s a crucial step for predicting and protecting towns and cities.
My personal goals were to come as close as possible to the real calculations that governments take to assume and predict this growth for their citizens. Another goal of mine were to encase the whole simulation in a nice and user-friendly graphical user interface that allows the user to interact with the simulation at the start and dynamically after one simulation has been created. I have gotten my inspiration of this project from https://askabiologist.asu.edu/covid-sim/. They have an advanced way of modeling covid spread over a period. But I have decided that I would be beneficial if I can make a model that could work with any virus/bacteria the user wanted by allowing them to ender custom parameters of a virus, But by default, if the user has not changed anything in the rates GUI then it will be a covid simulation.
